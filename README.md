Projects and Studies in Non Linear Programming


<b>Project I - Hanging Chain</b>
The Hanging Chain Project is presented in the sections 13.8, 14.7, 15.4, 17.4, and 18.4 of the book Numerical Optimization: Theoretical and Practical Aspects  (2006, second edition), by J.F. Bonnans, J.Ch. Gilbert, C. Lemaréchal, and C.A. Sagastizábal, Springer.

In this project, we propose to look at the problem of finding the static  equilibrium position of a chain made of rigid bars. The extreme joints of the chain are supposed to be fixed at two hooks and it is maintained above a given piecewise linear convex floor. The problem can be modeled as a minimization problem with equality and inequality constraints.
